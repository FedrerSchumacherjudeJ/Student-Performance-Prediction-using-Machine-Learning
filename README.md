# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on study hours, attendance, and marks.  Data preprocessing is performed to handle missing values, convert categorical data, and normalize features before training a Logistic Regression model.  The system helps identify students who need academic support.
